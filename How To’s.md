# How To’s
1. From anywhere in your Github repo you should see a navigation bar near the top of the page, find this and then press the option that says “Projects”.  ![](https://github.com/tpalzkill/CodeInnvoate-Oracle-TomsTeam/blob/master/img/How%20To%E2%80%99s/1.png)

2. Once you are in the “Projects” tab you will see 4 separate projects numbered from zero to three. Go ahead and click item “0 - Team Name” ![](https://github.com/tpalzkill/CodeInnvoate-Oracle-TomsTeam/blob/master/img/How%20To%E2%80%99s/2.png)

3. You will land on a page that looks like the image below. There should be a kanban board with just one column. In that column one person on your team will click the red boxed ellipsis you can see in the image below. A list of options will appear, select “Edit Note”. ![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/3%205.png)

4. Next, as a team, confer and come up with a team name. When you have reached a conclusion simply type it into the note. ![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/4%205.png)

5. Select “Save Note”  ![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/5%205.png)

6.Now again using the top navigation bar click on projects once more. ![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/6%205.png)

7. This time select item “1- Ideation” ![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/7%205.png)

8. Once you are in the ideation project board you should see a column for each one of your team members as well as two universal columns: In-Scope and Out-Of-Scope. To start remember to just work in your column. ![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/8%205.png)

9. To get yourself a larger workspace go ahead and click the fullscreen button in the top right of the page. ![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/9%205.png)

11. The solution engineer in your group should have explained that we will be adding ideas to our column. These ideas can be anything you’d like to achieve in Code Innovate. To begin adding these ideas find the plus icon in the top right of YOUR column and click. ![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/10%205.png)

12. Type out your ideas and click the green Add button ![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/12%205.png)

13. Other users ideas will appear in their column automatically, no need to refresh the page. ![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/13%205.png)

14.  After everyone has had the time to produce their ideas, as a team, you will decide what ideas will be in scope for code innovate and what ideas may need just a little bit more time. So for example, if my team decides it is in scope to build the rocket ship one person just needs to grab the card from my column and then drag it using the mouse to the in-scope column.![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/14%205.png)

15. Working with your team move all ideas to In-Scope or Out-Of-Scope columns. ![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/15%205.png)

23. You will  have landed on the Tasks Kanban board, to begin you should see three columns: To Do, In Progress and Done. The image below shows several tasks populated, your board will be empty. The idea here is straightforward: anything that needs to be done to reach out minimum goal needs to be made into Task as the task is started it is moved from to-do to in-progress, when it is complete it gets moved over to done. To start adding tasks click the plus symbol in the top right of the to-do column.![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/22%205.png)

24. Add a brief description of the task to complete then click the green add button. ![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/23%205.png)

25. When a team member begins working on a task they will come to this board and grab the card from to-do by clicking and holding then dragging to in progress ![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/24%205.png)

26. Similarly, when a team member completes a task they have been working on they will come back to this board and move the card from in progress to done.![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/25%205.png)

27. Occasionally you will hit problems on certain tasks and cannot move them to the done column without some help. Whether this is a bug, access issue or just a lack of documentation you can convert any task into an issue and assign it to an Oracle Engineer to resolve. 
To start find the task card that is giving you problems and hit the ellipsis icon in the top right of that card. ![](How%20To%E2%80%99s/26%205.png)
